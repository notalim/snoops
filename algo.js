// How would the main tinder algorithm work?
// 1. Users logs in
// 2. User is shown a list of dogs (based on his preferences)
// 3. User swipes right or left on the dog
// 4. If user swipes right, the dog is added to his list of liked dogs and the dog is added to his list of seen dogs
// 5. If user swipes left, the dog is added to his list of seen dogs
// 6. If there are no dogs left to show, the user is shown a message saying that there are no more dogs to show, and asked if he wants to see his liked dogs or start over
// 7. If the user wants to see his liked dogs, he is shown a list of his liked dogs
// 8. If the user wants to start over, he is shown a list of dogs again
