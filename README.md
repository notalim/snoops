# Snoops

Snoops is a Tinder-like application for people who are ready to adopt a new friend. We aim to create a way for adoption centers to post and promote their currently available dogs in a much more streamlined way to expedite the adoption process. Our goal is to encourage more people to adopt rather than buy from breeders, and by centralizing adoption centersâ€™ dogs into one spot, it reduces the friction of trying to adopt a dog.

Users are able to create one of two different types of accounts: adopter and adoption center. An adoption center can post and manage their own dog listings, and an adopter can browse the dog listings.
