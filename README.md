# Snoops

Snoops is a Tinder-like application for people who are ready to adopt a new friend. We aim to create a way for adoption centers to post and promote their currently available dogs in a much more streamlined way to expedite the adoption process. Our goal is to encourage more people to adopt rather than buy from breeders, and by centralizing adoption centersâ€™ dogs into one spot, it reduces the friction of trying to adopt a dog.

Users are able to create one of two different types of accounts: adopter and adoption center. An adoption center can post and manage their own dog listings, and an adopter can browse the dog listings.

## How to use

### Adoption Center Perspective

As an adoption center, you can create an account by selecting the "Adoption Center" option on the registration page. Once registered, you can:

1. Log in to your account.
2. Add a new dog to your listings by providing the necessary information such as name, breed, age, size, gender, and a photo.
3. Edit or delete existing dog listings.
4. Update your adoption center's information, including contact details and address.
5. Manage the adoption status of each dog, such as changing their status to "Available", "Adopted", or "Pending".

### User Perspective

As a user looking to adopt a dog, you can create an account by selecting the "Adopter" option on the registration page. Once registered, you can:

1. Log in to your account.
2. Browse available dogs by swiping through the listings.
3. Filter dogs based on your preferences, such as breed, age, size, and gender.
4. View detailed information about a dog.
5. Save dogs to your favorites list for future reference.
Contact the adoption center to initiate the adoption process.
