        <p class="aboutText">SnoopsTM, a Tinder-like application for
        people who are ready to adopt a new friend. We are aiming to
        create a way for adoption centers to post and promote their
        currently available dogs in a much more streamlined way to
        expedite the adoption process. We want more people to adopt
        rather than buy from breeders, and by centralizing adoption
        centersâ€™ dogs into one spot, it reduces the friction of trying
        to adopt a dog. Users are able to create one of two different
        types of accounts: adopter and adoption center. An adoption
        center can post and manage their own dog listings and an adopter
        can browse the dog listings.</p>
